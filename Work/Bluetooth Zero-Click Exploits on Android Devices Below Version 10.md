## Overview

Bluetooth zero-click exploits are vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a target device without any user interaction. Devices running Android versions below 10 are particularly susceptible to such attacks due to specific security flaws in their Bluetooth implementations.

## Key Terminology

- **Zero-Click Exploit**: A security vulnerability that can be exploited without any user interaction.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: A type of attack where an attacker can remotely execute commands on a device.
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**: A list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws.

## Notable Vulnerabilities

### CVE-2020-0022 (BlueFrag)

- **Description**: A critical Bluetooth RCE vulnerability affecting Android 8.0 and 9.0. An attacker within Bluetooth range can silently execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Bluetooth daemon, provided Bluetooth is enabled on the target device.
- **Impact**: Potential theft of personal data and the ability to spread malware to nearby vulnerable devices.

### CVE-2023-45866

- **Description**: An unauthenticated Bluetooth keystroke-injection vulnerability affecting multiple platforms, including Android versions below 10. Attackers can impersonate a Bluetooth keyboard to inject keystrokes without user interaction.
- **Impact**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands, install applications, and control the device without user consent.

## Exploitation Examples

### BlueFrag Exploit

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Attacker must be within Bluetooth range of the target device.
   - Target device has Bluetooth enabled.

2. **Attack Steps**:
   - Attacker discovers the Bluetooth MAC address of the target device.
   - Utilizes a crafted exploit to trigger the vulnerability, leading to RCE on the target device.

3. **Outcome**:
   - Attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code with Bluetooth daemon privileges, potentially accessing sensitive data or installing malware.

### Keystroke Injection via Bluetooth

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Attacker is within Bluetooth range.
   - Target device is unpatched and has Bluetooth enabled.

2. **Attack Steps**:
   - Attacker impersonates a Bluetooth keyboard.
   - Forces pairing with the target device without user interaction.
   - Sends keystrokes to execute commands or install malicious applications.

3. **Outcome**:
   - Full control over the target device without any physical interaction or user awareness.

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Update Devices**: Ensure devices are running the latest Android version with all security patches applied.
- **Disable Bluetooth**: Turn off Bluetooth when not in use to minimize exposure.
- **Monitor for Updates**: Regularly check for security updates and advisories related to Bluetooth vulnerabilities.
