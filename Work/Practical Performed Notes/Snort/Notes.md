## Introduction

Snort 3 is the latest version of the Snort engine, featuring significant improvements over its predecessor, Snort 2. It offers enhanced performance, scalability, and a modular architecture with over 200 plugins, allowing users to customize their intrusion detection and prevention setups effectively. Notable enhancements include multi-threading capabilities, a more flexible rule syntax, and improved protocol inspection. 
## Installation

To install Snort 3, follow these general steps:

1. **System Requirements**: Ensure your system meets the necessary requirements, including a compatible operating system (e.g., Linux, FreeBSD) and required dependencies like a C++ compiler, CMake, and PCRE libraries.
    
2. **Download Snort 3**: Obtain the latest Snort 3 source code from the official Snort website or its GitHub repository.
    
3. **Build and Install**:
    
    - Extract the downloaded source code.
        
    - Navigate to the extracted directory.
        
    - Run the following commands to build and install Snort 3:
        
        ```bash
         ./configure
        make
        sudo make install 
        ```
        
    - Ensure all dependencies are satisfied during the configuration process.
        

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [Snort 3 Rule Writing Guide](https://docs.snort.org/start/).

## Configuration

After installation, configure Snort 3 to suit your network environment:

4. **Configuration File**: The primary configuration file is `snort.lua`. This Lua-based configuration offers flexibility and modularity.
    
5. **Editing `snort.lua`**:
    
    - Define network variables, such as home and external networks.
    - Specify the location of rule files.
    - Enable or disable preprocessors and plugins as needed.
6. **Include Rule Sets**: Download and include appropriate rule sets to detect various threats. Ensure the rule paths are correctly specified in the configuration file.
    

For comprehensive configuration guidance, consult the [Snort 3 Rule Writing Guide](https://docs.snort.org/start/).

## Running Snort 3

To start Snort 3:

- **Command-Line Execution**: Use the following command to run Snort with your configuration:
    
    ```bash
    snort -c /path/to/snort.lua -i <interface>
    ```
    
    - `-c`: Specifies the path to the configuration file.
    - `-i`: Designates the network interface to monitor.
- **Validation Mode**: Before deploying, validate your configuration with:
    
    ```bash
    snort -c /path/to/snort.lua -T
    ```
    
    This checks for errors without starting packet capture.
    

For a detailed overview of command-line options, refer to the [Snort 3 Rule Writing Guide](https://docs.snort.org/start/help).

## Writing Snort Rules

Snort 3 introduces an updated rule syntax to enhance detection capabilities:

7. **Rule Structure**: A typical Snort rule consists of:
    
    - **Header**: Defines action, protocol, source/destination IPs, and ports.
    - **Options**: Specifies the detection criteria and metadata.
    
    Example rule:
    
    ```plaintext
     alert tcp any any -> any 80 (
        msg: "Example rule";
        content: "malicious_payload";
        sid: 1000001;
        rev: 1;
    ) 
    ```
    
8. **Rule Actions**: Common actions include `alert`, `log`, `pass`, `drop`, and `reject`.
    
9. **Protocols**: Rules can be written for various protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP.
    
10. **Content Matching**: Use the `content` keyword to search for specific patterns within packet payloads.
    
11. **Metadata**: Incorporate `sid` (Signature ID), `rev` (Revision), and `msg` (Message) for rule identification and management.
