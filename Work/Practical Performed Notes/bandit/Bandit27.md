you need to clone the github repo so we need **git**
and the command used is **git clone**
so there is a simple logic that you have to follow dont just copy it and paste on the terminal and do git clone
i meant for the string
you have to understand the format for that so enter the string properly as you also need the port no

i have showed you the difference between the command that you should enter to get proper output
command to get the repo:**git clone "ssh://bandit27-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo"**
so you will prompt with password 
enter the password you got from the [[Bandit26]]
and then hit enter
you will get the repo
then do **cd** and then check the readme file inside of it
you will get the password for next level
