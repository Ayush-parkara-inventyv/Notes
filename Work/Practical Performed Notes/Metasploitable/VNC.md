first i did
 **search vnc 3.3**
 in that i used 4th one 
 **4  auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login        .     normal   No     VNC Authentication Scanner**
 after using this i set the RHOSTS and did further steps
 where i got the vnc password: password

then i figured out how to do login using this and then i did vnc
**vncviewer 192.168.177.128:5900**
then it prompted for password and then entered the password and i got the shell access here 
BINGO!!!!!!!!
