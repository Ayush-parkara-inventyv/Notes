## **Introduction to ISO/IEC 27001**
ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard that provides a framework for organizations to manage information security effectively. It specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). The standard ensures that an organization's sensitive information—such as financial data, intellectual property, or personal records—is protected from various threats.

Key Features of ISO 27001:
- **Risk-based approach**: Organizations must identify and mitigate risks to their information assets.
- **Holistic security**: It covers people, processes, and technology.
- **Flexibility**: Applicable to organizations of all sizes and industries.
- **Certification**: Provides a recognized certification that demonstrates an organization's commitment to information security.

## **Clause 1: Scope**
This clause outlines the scope of the standard. ISO/IEC 27001 is applicable to any organization seeking to manage information security. It focuses on the protection of information assets, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Key Points:
- The ISMS can be applied to any type or size of organization.
- It applies to all types of information, whether it is stored electronically, on paper, or as verbal communication.
- The standard integrates with other management systems (e.g., ISO 9001 for quality management).
