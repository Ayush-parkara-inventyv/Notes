## Overview
CUpp (Common User Passwords Profiler) is a tool designed to generate password lists based on information gathered about a target. It creates custom password lists by leveraging personal information, such as a person’s name, date of birth, username, and other identifiable details. These generated lists can then be used for password cracking attempts during penetration tests or brute-force attacks.

CUpp works by combining the gathered personal data and transforming it into a list of potential passwords based on common password patterns and conventions, such as adding numbers or symbols to a name. This method is highly effective for cracking weak passwords, which are often based on easily guessable personal information.

## Key Terminology
- **Password Cracking**: The process of trying different passwords to gain unauthorized access to a system or account.
- **Dictionary Attack**: An attack where the attacker uses a list of known words or guesses, such as a wordlist generated by CUpp, to crack passwords.
- **Brute-force Attack**: A method where the attacker attempts every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. CUpp helps to create lists that reduce the time required in such attacks by providing a more focused set of possible passwords.

## Installing CUpp
CUpp is a Python-based tool and can be installed easily on Linux or macOS systems.

### 1. Install Dependencies
To use CUpp, first, ensure that you have **Python 3** and **git** installed on your system.

For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can install the necessary dependencies with:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git
````

### 2. Clone CUpp Repository

CUpp is available on GitHub. To install it, you will need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the CUpp directory:

```bash
cd cupp
```

### 3. Make CUpp Executable (Optional)

Make sure that the `cupp.py` script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x cupp.py
```

You can now run CUpp using:

```bash
python3 cupp.py
```

## Basic Usage of CUpp

### 1. Start CUpp Interactive Mode

Once CUpp is installed, you can start the interactive mode by running:

```bash
python3 cupp.py -i
```

This command will prompt you for the target’s information, such as the first and last name, date of birth, username, and other details. Based on this information, CUpp will generate a custom password list.

### 2. Generating Password Lists

In the interactive mode, CUpp will ask a series of questions about the target. You can answer the following typical prompts:

- **First Name**: The first name of the target.
- **Last Name**: The last name of the target.
- **Nickname**: If the target uses a nickname or online alias.
- **Date of Birth**: The target’s birth date (this can also be split into day, month, and year).
- **Favorite Color**: Useful if the person’s favorite color might be part of their password.
- **City of Birth**: A city or place of birth, often used in password generation.

After gathering this data, CUpp will generate passwords based on different combinations, such as:

- `FirstnameLastname`
- `Firstname123`
- `Lastname1980`
- `Firstname!CityName`
- and more variations like appending numbers and special characters.

### 3. Export Password List

Once CUpp finishes generating the password list, you can export it to a file by specifying the output filename:

```bash
python3 cupp.py -o [password_list.txt]
```

This will save the generated password list to a text file, which you can then use for brute-force or dictionary-based attacks.

## Advanced CUpp Usage

### 1. Customizing Password Generation

CUpp allows you to customize the password generation process by adjusting the questions or providing specific parameters.

- **Custom User Information**: You can use the `-u` flag to pass custom user details in a CSV format:
    
    ```bash
    python3 cupp.py -u first_name,last_name,nickname,dob,favorite_color,city
    ```
    
- **Set Specific Number of Passwords**: You can specify how many passwords to generate by using the `-n` flag:
    
    ```bash
    python3 cupp.py -n 500 -o custom_wordlist.txt
    ```
    
- **Combining Words from Wordlists**: CUpp can also combine words from external wordlists with user data. This is useful when you want to generate more comprehensive password lists by combining dictionary words with the target's details:
    
    ```bash
    python3 cupp.py -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -o combined_wordlist.txt
    ```

### 2. Running CUpp Without Interactive Mode

You can also generate password lists without the interactive mode by specifying details directly in the command line. For example:

```bash
python3 cupp.py -p first_name last_name -d date_of_birth -o output_file.txt
```

## Practical Use Cases

- **Penetration Testing**: CUpp is often used in password cracking exercises during penetration tests. By gathering personal information about a target, a custom password list can be generated to attempt cracking weak passwords.
- **Social Engineering**: CUpp can assist attackers by generating passwords that are likely to be used by individuals who rely on common password patterns based on personal details.
- **Wi-Fi Network Cracking**: CUpp-generated password lists are frequently used for cracking WPA and WPA2 passwords when attackers have access to captured handshakes.

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Use Strong, Complex Passwords**: Avoid using easily guessable personal information such as names, dates of birth, or locations in passwords.
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor of authentication, making password-only attacks less effective.
- **Limit Personal Information Exposure**: Be cautious about sharing personal details on social media or public platforms, as this information can be leveraged by attackers.
- **Use a Password Manager**: Password managers generate and store strong, random passwords that are harder to crack.
