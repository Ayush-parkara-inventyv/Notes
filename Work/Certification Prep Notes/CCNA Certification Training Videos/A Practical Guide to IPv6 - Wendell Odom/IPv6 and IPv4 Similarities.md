### IPv6 and IPv4 Similarities
![](https://i.imgur.com/xRjODR8.png)
This image explains how **IPv6 and IPv4 handle connected and local routes in a similar way**. It compares the `show ipv6 route` command with the `show ip route` command in Cisco routers.

---
### **Key Concepts: Connected and Local Routes**

- **Connected Routes (`C`)**
    
    - These routes belong to networks that are **directly connected** to the router's interfaces.
    - In the routing table, they appear with a `C` code.
    - Example from the IPv4 routing table:
        
        ```
        C  172.16.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0
        C  172.16.4.0/24 is directly connected, Serial0/0
        ```
        
    - These networks are reachable **without needing additional routing**.
- **Local Routes (`L`)**
    
    - These represent the **specific IP assigned to the router's interface** within a directly connected subnet.
    - Example from the IPv4 routing table:
        
        ```
        L  172.16.1.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0
        L  172.16.4.1/32 is directly connected, Serial0/0
        ```
        
    - In IPv6, similar local routes exist for each assigned address.

---
### **Comparison of Commands**

1. **`show ipv6 route`**
    - Used to display the IPv6 routing table, showing both **connected (`C`)** and **local (`L`)** routes.
    - Works similarly to the IPv4 command but includes IPv6-specific routes.
2. **`show ip route`**
    - Displays the IPv4 routing table.
    - Uses the same concepts (`C` for connected and `L` for local).

---
### **Key Takeaways**

✅ Both **IPv4 and IPv6 use connected (`C`) and local (`L`) routes**.  
✅ `show ip route` (IPv4) and `show ipv6 route` (IPv6) provide similar outputs.  
✅ Connected networks are automatically added to the routing table when an interface is configured.

### OSPF v2 and v3

![](https://i.imgur.com/zZZ7mQG.png)

### OSPF v2 sample configs
this configs are 3 diff types of configs or say methods that are used to set ospf for any router connection.
![](https://i.imgur.com/jLuC4bT.png)
This image explains different **OSPFv2 (Open Shortest Path First version 2) configurations** for a router (R1) with three interfaces.

---
### **Understanding OSPFv2 Configuration**

OSPF is a link-state routing protocol used in IPv4 networks. The different configurations in the image show various ways to define which interfaces participate in OSPF.

---
### **Types of OSPF Configurations in the Image**

1. **Configuration 1:**
    
    ```plaintext
    router ospf 1
     network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0
    ```
    
    - This configuration **enables OSPF on all interfaces** because the network statement covers **all IP addresses** (`0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255`).
    - Useful for quick deployment but less specific.
2. **Configuration 2:**
    
    ```plaintext
    router ospf 1
     network 172.16.1.1 0.0.0.0 area 0
     network 172.16.4.1 0.0.0.0 area 0
     network 172.16.5.1 0.0.0.0 area 0
    ```
    
    - This configuration **explicitly enables OSPF on specific IP addresses** (`172.16.1.1`, `172.16.4.1`, `172.16.5.1`).
    - The wildcard mask `0.0.0.0` means **only that exact IP address is included**.
    - Best used when only specific interfaces should run OSPF.
3. **Configuration 3:**
    
    ```plaintext
    router ospf 1
     network 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0
    ```
    
    - This configuration **enables OSPF for all interfaces within the 172.16.0.0/16 network**.
    - The wildcard mask `0.0.255.255` covers all IP addresses in the range **172.16.0.0 - 172.16.255.255**.
    - More efficient than listing each interface separately.

---
### **Network Diagram**

- **Router R1** has three interfaces:
    - `G0/0` with IP `172.16.1.1`
    - `S0/0/0` with IP `172.16.4.1`
    - `G0/1` with IP `172.16.5.1`
- The diagram shows how these interfaces are connected, with `S0/0/0` leading to another network.

---
### **Key Takeaways**

✅ **Different OSPF network commands impact which interfaces participate.**  
✅ **The first config enables OSPF on all interfaces**, while the second **selects specific IPs** and the third **uses a subnet-based approach**.  
✅ **Choosing the right approach depends on the network structure and management preference.**

### OSPF v3 sample config
this are the methods that are used to setup ospf area to the router interface
![](https://i.imgur.com/N2xxduC.png)
This image explains **OSPFv3 (Open Shortest Path First version 3) configuration for IPv6**, focusing on enabling OSPF per **interface** rather than using network statements.

---
### **Key Differences from OSPFv2 (IPv4)**

1. **OSPFv2 (IPv4) uses the `network` command** to define which interfaces participate in OSPF.
2. **OSPFv3 (IPv6) does not use the `network` command**. Instead, OSPF is enabled **directly on interfaces** using the command:
    
    ```
    ipv6 ospf <process-id> area <area-number>
    ```
    
---
### **Breaking Down the Configuration**

#### **Step 1: Enable OSPFv3 Process**
```plaintext
ipv6 router ospf 1
 router-id 1.1.1.1
 passive-interface G0/0
```

- **`ipv6 router ospf 1`** → Starts the OSPFv3 process with ID `1`.
- **`router-id 1.1.1.1`** → Sets a **32-bit router ID** (needed even in IPv6).
- **`passive-interface G0/0`** → Prevents OSPF advertisements on `G0/0` but still allows it to be advertised.

#### **Step 2: Assign Interfaces to OSPFv3**
```plaintext
interface G0/0
 ipv6 ospf 1 area 0
```

- Enables OSPFv3 on **GigabitEthernet 0/0** in **Area 0**.

```plaintext
interface S0/0/0
 ipv6 ospf 1 area 0
```

- Enables OSPFv3 on **Serial 0/0/0** in **Area 0**.

```plaintext
interface G0/1
 ipv6 ospf 1 area 0
```

- Enables OSPFv3 on **GigabitEthernet 0/1** in **Area 0**.
---
### **Network Diagram**

- Router **R1** has three interfaces:
    - `G0/0` → `2001:DB8:A:1111::1/64`
    - `S0/0/0` → `2001:DB8:A:4444::1/64`
    - `G0/1` → `2001:DB8:A:5555::1/64`
- These interfaces are **connected to different networks** and participate in OSPFv3.
---
### **Key Takeaways**

✅ **OSPFv3 is enabled per interface** instead of using a `network` command like OSPFv2.  
✅ **A router ID is still required** (even though OSPFv3 is for IPv6).  
✅ **Passive interfaces can be configured** to prevent OSPF updates on certain links.

![](https://i.imgur.com/pbD555Q.png)

### OSPF v2 config -by interface

![](https://i.imgur.com/y8YdbIf.png)
This image explains **OSPFv2 (Open Shortest Path First version 2) configuration for IPv4** using the **interface-based approach**, rather than the traditional `network` statement method.

---
### **Key Differences from Traditional OSPFv2 Configuration**

1. **OSPFv2 usually defines networks under `router ospf <process-id>` using the `network` command**.
2. **This method enables OSPFv2 per interface**, similar to OSPFv3 for IPv6.

---
### **Breaking Down the Configuration**

#### **Step 1: Enable OSPFv2 Process**

```plaintext
router ospf 1
 passive-interface G0/0
 router-id 1.1.1.1
```

- **`router ospf 1`** → Starts the OSPF process with ID `1`.
- **`passive-interface G0/0`** → Prevents OSPF updates on `G0/0` (but still advertises it).
- **`router-id 1.1.1.1`** → Sets a **32-bit router ID** (used for OSPF identification).

#### **Step 2: Assign Interfaces to OSPFv2**

```plaintext
interface G0/0
 ip ospf 1 area 0
```

- Enables **OSPFv2 on GigabitEthernet 0/0** in **Area 0**.

```plaintext
interface S0/0/0
 ip ospf 1 area 0
```

- Enables **OSPFv2 on Serial 0/0/0** in **Area 0**.

```plaintext
interface G0/1
 ip ospf 1 area 0
```

- Enables **OSPFv2 on GigabitEthernet 0/1** in **Area 0**.

---
### **Network Diagram**

- Router **R1** has three interfaces:
    - `G0/0` → `172.16.1.1`
    - `S0/0/0` → `172.16.4.1`
    - `G0/1` → `172.16.5.1`
- These interfaces are **connected to different networks** and participate in OSPFv2.

---
### **Key Takeaways**

✅ **OSPFv2 can be enabled per interface**, similar to OSPFv3 (IPv6).  
✅ **No `network` command is used**; instead, OSPF is configured directly on interfaces.  
✅ **A router ID is still required** for OSPF operations.  
✅ **Passive interfaces can be configured** to prevent OSPF updates while still advertising the network.

### OSPF v2 and v3 commands

![](https://i.imgur.com/HkQEwM8.png)
This image compares **OSPFv2 (for IPv4) and OSPFv3 (for IPv6) commands**, highlighting their similarities and differences in functionality.

---
### **Key Sections of OSPF Operation**

The image organizes OSPF commands into different functional categories:

1. **Config (Configuration)**
    
    - Used to verify OSPF configuration.
    - Command:
        
        ```
        show running-config
        ```
        
2. **Enabled Interfaces**
    
    - Checks which interfaces are running OSPF.
    - Commands:
        
        ```

        show ipv6 ospf interface type number
        show ipv6 ospf interface brief
        ```
        
3. **Neighbors (OSPF Neighbor Discovery)**
    
    - Displays OSPF neighbors detected via **Hello packets**.
    - Commands:
        
        ```
        show ipv6 ospf neighbor
        show ipv6 ospf neighbor type number
        ```
        
4. **LSDB (Link-State Database)**
    
    - Shows the OSPF **Link-State Database** (LSDB), which contains OSPF link-state advertisements (LSAs).
    - Command:
        
        ```
        show ipv6 ospf database
        ```
        
5. **Routes (SPF Calculation)**
    
    - Displays OSPF-learned routes.
    - Commands:
        
        ```

        show ipv6 route subnet mask
        show ipv6 route | section subnet
        ```
        

---
### **Key Differences Between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3**

|Feature|OSPFv2 (IPv4)|OSPFv3 (IPv6)|
|---|---|---|
|**Configuration**|`router ospf <process-id>` + `network` statements|`ipv6 router ospf <process-id>` + interface-based activation|
|**Interface Activation**|Uses `network <IP> <wildcard>` under OSPF|Uses `ipv6 ospf <pid> area <id>` per interface|
|**Neighbor Discovery**|`show ip ospf neighbor`|`show ipv6 ospf neighbor`|
|**Route Verification**|`show ip route ospf`|`show ipv6 route ospf`|
|**LSDB**|`show ip ospf database`|`show ipv6 ospf database`|

---
### **Key Takeaways**

✅ **OSPFv3 (IPv6) does not use the `network` statement**—it is enabled per interface.  
✅ **Most OSPF commands remain similar** but are prefixed with `ipv6`.  
✅ **Neighbor discovery, LSDB, and SPF calculations remain functionally the same** between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  
✅ **OSPFv3 supports IPv6 natively**, making it necessary for modern networks.


![](https://i.imgur.com/PlGTKbm.png)
This screenshot shows the output of **OSPF neighbor verification commands** for both **OSPFv2 (IPv4)** and **OSPFv3 (IPv6)** on a router named **R1**.

---
### **Understanding the Output**

#### **1️⃣ OSPFv2 Neighbor Table (`show ip ospf neighbor`)**

- This command shows **OSPFv2 (IPv4) neighbors**.
- The table lists:
    - **Neighbor ID**: The Router ID (RID) of the neighboring router.
    - **Priority (Pri)**: The router priority for DR/BDR election.
    - **State**:
        - `FULL/DR` → Neighbor is fully adjacent and is the Designated Router (DR).
        - `FULL/-` → Fully adjacent but not a DR or BDR.
    - **Dead Time**: Time before the neighbor is declared down.
    - **Address**: The neighbor's IP address.
    - **Interface**: The local interface used to connect to the neighbor.

|Neighbor ID|Pri|State|Dead Time|Address|Interface|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2.2.2.2|0|FULL/-|00:00:31|172.16.4.2|Serial0/0/0|
|3.3.3.3|1|FULL/DR|00:00:31|172.16.5.3|GigabitEthernet0/1|

#### **2️⃣ OSPFv3 Neighbor Table (`show ipv6 ospf neighbor`)**

- This command shows **OSPFv3 (IPv6) neighbors**.
- The structure is similar to OSPFv2 but includes **Interface ID** instead of IP addresses.

|Neighbor ID|Pri|State|Dead Time|Interface ID|Interface|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2.2.2.2|0|FULL/-|00:00:38|7|Serial0/0/0|
|3.3.3.3|1|FULL/DR|00:00:32|4|GigabitEthernet0/1|

---
### **Key Takeaways**

✅ **Same Neighbor Relationships in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3**

- The same neighbor routers (2.2.2.2 and 3.3.3.3) appear in both tables.
- The **Designated Router (DR) and non-DR roles remain the same**.

✅ **Differences Between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3**

- **OSPFv2 (IPv4) shows the neighbor’s IP address**, while **OSPFv3 (IPv6) shows the Interface ID** instead of an IP.
- **Interface IDs (7 and 4) replace IPv6 addresses in OSPFv3 neighbor relationships**.

✅ **Both OSPF versions are running on R1**

- This router is running both **OSPFv2 (for IPv4)** and **OSPFv3 (for IPv6)** simultaneously.
- The interfaces Serial0/0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/1 are participating in both protocols.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zSnLOxM.png)
This screenshot shows the output of **OSPF interface status commands** for both **OSPFv2 (IPv4) and OSPFv3 (IPv6)** on a router named **R1**.

---
### **Understanding the Output**

The two sections display the results of the following commands:

1. **`show ip ospf interface brief`** → Displays OSPFv2 (IPv4) interface details.
2. **`show ipv6 ospf interface brief`** → Displays OSPFv3 (IPv6) interface details.

#### **1️⃣ OSPFv2 (IPv4) Interface Summary (`show ip ospf interface brief`)**

|Interface|PID|Area|IP Address/Mask|Cost|State|Neighbors (Nbrs)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Se0/0/0|1|0|172.16.4.1/24|64|P2P|1/1|
|Gi0/1|1|0|172.16.5.1/24|1|BDR|1/1|
|Gi0/0|1|0|172.16.1.1/24|1|DR|0/0|

- **Process ID (PID)**: All interfaces belong to **OSPF process 1**.
- **Area**: All interfaces are in **Area 0**.
- **Cost**:
    - Serial **0/0/0 has a cost of 64** (higher because it's a lower bandwidth link).
    - Gigabit **interfaces have a cost of 1**.
- **State**:
    - **P2P (Point-to-Point)** → Used on Serial0/0/0.
    - **BDR (Backup Designated Router)** → Gi0/1 is the Backup DR.
    - **DR (Designated Router)** → Gi0/0 is the DR.
- **Nbrs (Neighbors Count)**:
    - **1/1** means there is **one fully adjacent neighbor**.
    - **0/0** on Gi0/0 means there are **no OSPF neighbors on that interface**.

---

#### **2️⃣ OSPFv3 (IPv6) Interface Summary (`show ipv6 ospf interface brief`)**

|Interface|PID|Area|Intf ID|Cost|State|Nbrs|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Se0/0/0|1|0|6|64|P2P|1/1|
|Gi0/1|1|0|4|1|BDR|1/1|
|Gi0/0|1|0|3|1|DR|0/0|

- **Interface ID (Intf ID)**:
    - Instead of IP addresses, OSPFv3 uses Interface IDs.
- **Cost, States, and Neighbors**:
    - The states and neighbor counts match **OSPFv2 exactly**.
    - This confirms that **both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 run on the same interfaces with identical roles**.

---
### **Key Takeaways**

✅ **Same Interface Roles for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3**

- **OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 have identical DR/BDR roles, costs, and neighbors.**

✅ **Point-to-Point (P2P) for Serial Links**

- Serial0/0/0 is running **P2P mode** in both versions.

✅ **Gigabit Interfaces Run DR/BDR Elections**

- **Gi0/0 is the DR**, and **Gi0/1 is the BDR**.

✅ **OSPFv3 Uses Interface IDs Instead of IPs**

- Instead of displaying IPv6 addresses, OSPFv3 shows **Interface IDs (6, 4, 3)**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7m5Q0TL.png)
This screenshot displays the output of the following commands on router **R1**:

1. **`show ip route ospf`** → Displays OSPF-learned **IPv4** routes.
2. **`show ipv6 route ospf`** → Displays OSPF-learned **IPv6** routes.

---
## **Understanding the Output**

The routing table shows **OSPF-learned routes** for both **IPv4 and IPv6**.

### **1️⃣ IPv4 OSPF Routes (`show ip route ospf`)**

```
172.16.2.0/24 [110/65] via 172.16.4.2, 21:33:44, Serial0/0/0
172.16.3.0/24 [110/2] via 172.16.5.3, 21:33:06, GigabitEthernet0/1
```

- **OSPF Administrative Distance (AD):**
    - **110** (default for OSPF).
- **Metric (Cost):**
    - **65** for 172.16.2.0/24 (higher cost, likely due to Serial link).
    - **2** for 172.16.3.0/24 (lower cost, likely due to Gigabit link).
- **Next-hop:**
    - **172.16.4.2 via Serial0/0/0** (for 172.16.2.0/24).
    - **172.16.5.3 via GigabitEthernet0/1** (for 172.16.3.0/24).
- **Time since last update:**
    - 21 minutes and 33 seconds.

---
### **2️⃣ IPv6 OSPF Routes (`show ipv6 route ospf`)**

```
2001:DB8:A:2222::/64 [110/65] via FE80::22FF:FEE2:2222, Serial0/0/0
2001:DB8:A:3333::/64 [110/2] via FE80::CCFF:FECC:CCCC, GigabitEthernet0/1
```

- **Prefixes:**
    - `2001:DB8:A:2222::/64` learned via Serial0/0/0.
    - `2001:DB8:A:3333::/64` learned via GigabitEthernet0/1.
- **Link-Local Next-Hop Addresses:**
    - `FE80::22FF:FEE2:2222` (for Serial0/0/0).
    - `FE80::CCFF:FECC:CCCC` (for GigabitEthernet0/1).
- **OSPFv3 Administrative Distance (AD):**
    - **110** (default for OSPFv3).
- **Metric (Cost):**
    - **65** (for Serial link).
    - **2** (for Gigabit link).

---
## **Key Takeaways**

✅ **OSPF is used to learn both IPv4 and IPv6 routes**

- OSPFv2 is used for IPv4, and OSPFv3 is used for IPv6.

✅ **Serial0/0/0 has a higher cost than GigabitEthernet0/1**

- This is expected since Serial links usually have lower bandwidth.

✅ **OSPFv3 uses link-local next-hop addresses**

- Instead of global IPv6 addresses, OSPFv3 uses **link-local addresses (FE80::)** as next-hops.


![](https://i.imgur.com/BbGs2Wl.png)
This image explains **Static IPv4 Routes** using two different methods of defining a static route on **Router R1** to reach the **172.16.2.0/24 network** via **Router R2**.

---
### **1️⃣ Understanding the Static Route Commands**

The two static route commands in the image are:

1. **`ip route 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 S0/0/0`**
    
    - This configures a static route using the **exit interface** (Serial0/0/0).
    - This means that any packets destined for **172.16.2.0/24** will be forwarded directly out **Serial0/0/0**.
    - The router will perform **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** to determine the next-hop MAC address.
2. **`ip route 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.4.2`**
    
    - This configures a static route using the **next-hop IP address** (**172.16.4.2**, which is R2's Serial interface).
    - This method is **more efficient** because the router knows exactly where to forward the packet without needing to perform ARP.

---
### **2️⃣ Network Topology Breakdown**

- **R1** and **R2** are connected via **Serial0/0/0**.
- R2 has a directly connected network **172.16.2.0/24**.
- R1 needs to reach **172.16.2.0/24**, so it sets up a **static route**.

---
### **3️⃣ Key Differences Between the Two Methods**

|Method|Uses Exit Interface|Uses Next-Hop IP|ARP Required?|Recommended?|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`ip route 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 S0/0/0`|✅ Yes|❌ No|✅ Yes (for Layer 2 resolution)|❌ Not recommended for point-to-multipoint|
|`ip route 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.4.2`|❌ No|✅ Yes|❌ No (next-hop is known)|✅ Recommended|

---
### **4️⃣ Best Practice**

- Using the **next-hop IP address (`172.16.4.2`)** is generally the **better option** because:
    - It avoids unnecessary **ARP resolution**.
    - It works better in **point-to-multipoint** environments.
    - It ensures that the router always forwards packets to the correct destination.


![](https://i.imgur.com/fgHJqJs.png)
This image explains **Static IPv6 Routing** and how it is similar to **Static IPv4 Routing**. It demonstrates two ways to configure a static route on **Router R1** to reach the **2001:DB8:A:2222::/64 network** via **Router R2**.

---
### **1️⃣ Understanding the Static Route Commands**

The two static route commands in the image are:

1. **`ipv6 route 2001:DB8:A:2222::/64 S0/0/0`**
    
    - This configures a static route using the **exit interface** (**Serial0/0/0**).
    - It means that any packet destined for **2001:DB8:A:2222::/64** will be sent **directly out of Serial0/0/0**.
    - The router will need to **discover the next-hop address using NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol)**.
2. **`ipv6 route 2001:DB8:A:2222::/64 2001:DB8:A:4444::2`**
    
    - This configures a static route using the **next-hop IPv6 address** (**2001:DB8:A:4444::2**, which is R2’s serial interface).
    - This is **more efficient** because the router **knows exactly where to send the packet**, avoiding the need for additional next-hop discovery.

---
### **2️⃣ Network Topology Breakdown**

- **R1 and R2 are connected via Serial0/0/0**.
- **R2 has a directly connected network 2001:DB8:A:2222::/64**.
- **R1 needs to reach this network**, so it sets up a **static route**.

### **3️⃣ Key Differences Between the Two Methods**

|Method|Uses Exit Interface|Uses Next-Hop IP|NDP (Neighbor Discovery) Required?|Recommended?|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`ipv6 route 2001:DB8:A:2222::/64 S0/0/0`|✅ Yes|❌ No|✅ Yes (to resolve next-hop)|❌ Not ideal for point-to-multipoint|
|`ipv6 route 2001:DB8:A:2222::/64 2001:DB8:A:4444::2`|❌ No|✅ Yes|❌ No (next-hop is explicitly defined)|✅ Recommended|

---
### **4️⃣ Best Practice**

- Using the **next-hop IPv6 address (`2001:DB8:A:4444::2`)** is **better** because:
    - It avoids unnecessary **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) lookups**.
    - It provides **better control over routing**.
    - It works better in **point-to-multipoint environments**.

---
### **5️⃣ IPv6 vs. IPv4 Static Routing Similarities**

- **Both IPv4 and IPv6 static routes can be configured using either an exit interface or a next-hop IP.**
- **Using a next-hop address is more efficient in both cases.**
- **In IPv4, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) resolves unknown next-hops, whereas in IPv6, NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) does the same.**

This image explains how to configure **IPv6 Static Routes using Link-Local Addresses**.

### **1️⃣ Understanding the Static Route Command**

The command shown in the image is:

```plaintext
ipv6 route 2001:DB8:A:2222::/64 FE80::1 S0/0/0
```

- `2001:DB8:A:2222::/64` → The destination network (IPv6 subnet that R1 wants to reach).
- `FE80::1` → The **link-local address** of the next-hop router (R2).
- `S0/0/0` → The **exit interface** on R1.

---
### **2️⃣ What is a Link-Local Address (FE80::/10)?**

- **Link-local addresses** (starting with `FE80::/10`) are automatically assigned to every IPv6 interface.
- They are **only valid within a single link** (not routable beyond the local network segment).
- Used for **next-hop communication in routing protocols** (e.g., static routing, OSPFv3, EIGRP for IPv6).

---
### **3️⃣ How This Works**

1. **R1 wants to send traffic to `2001:DB8:A:2222::/64`**.
2. **R1 sends packets to `FE80::1` out of `S0/0/0`**.
3. **`FE80::1` is R2's link-local address** on that interface.
4. **R2 forwards the packets to the correct destination (`2001:DB8:A:2222::/64`)**.

---
### **4️⃣ Why Use a Link-Local Address Instead of a Global IPv6 Address?**

✅ **Link-local addresses never change**, even if the global IPv6 addresses change.  
✅ **Required in some routing protocols** like OSPFv3.  
✅ **Simplifies network design** by avoiding dependencies on global addressing.

---
### **5️⃣ Key Takeaways**

🔹 **When using a link-local address as the next-hop, the exit interface 
    (`S0/0/0`) must be specified.**  
🔹 **Link-local addresses are valid only within the local link.**  
🔹 **This method ensures static routing works even if global IPv6 addresses change.**
