network design is basically designing or building a network from scratch or editing and improving existing network and doing so on the requirements of the clients.

it is not only about the tech, its also about the capex and opex 
now what are the both terms mentioned here

CAPEX: (capital expenditure) which is basically the cost to buy a new system or we can say the hardware components and stuff that is required to build a network on

OPEX:( operating expenditure) which is the expenditure that is done for the maintaining of the things like liquid cooling

1. **Greenfield**
    
    - **Example:** Imagine building a brand-new data center with no existing infrastructure — you can freely choose hardware, software, and architecture.
    - **Use Case:** Often seen in startups, new branch offices, or fresh product development.
2. **Brownfield**
    
    - **Example:** Upgrading an old software system to modern cloud infrastructure without disrupting ongoing operations.

3. **High Level Design (HLD)**
    
    - **Example:** A blueprint that shows how major components like databases, servers, and APIs connect but doesn’t specify the actual code.
    - **Use Case:** Useful for stakeholder presentations or architectural planning.
4. **Low Level Design (LLD)**
    
    - **Example:** Describing the database schema, API endpoints, or function-level logic for developers to follow.

7. **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)**
    
    - **Example:** If a network switch fails, MTTR is the average time it takes for technicians to identify and fix the issue.
    - **Use Case:** Used in SLA (Service Level Agreement) metrics to ensure minimal downtime.
8. **Bill of Material (BoM)**
    
    - **Example:** A detailed parts list for assembling a computer, including CPUs, RAM, cables, and screws.
    - **Use Case:** Crucial for manufacturing, hardware projects, and inventory management.
