password written in [[Bandit1]] is used to login to bandit2
now doing **ssh** to login to the bandit2 
**ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220**
now password from bandit1 
it gives the hint that the filename contains spaces
to give file name including spaces is done by giving file name in **""**
so i used the same **cat** command and gave file name in double quotation
**cat "spaces in this filename"**
so the password is 
**password:MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx**
